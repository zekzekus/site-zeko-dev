A software developer, manager, and open-source enthusiast with years of experience leading teams and building innovative products. As a proud father of two and a lifelong learner, Iâ€™m passionate about creating meaningful solutions and sharing knowledge. Currently, I live in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with my wife and children, embracing both personal and professional growth every step of the way.
